=> Java File:-
-> file extention : .java
-> Main public Class Name and file name should match
-> to run java file main public Class should have main() method
-> Boilerplate Code:-

    class ClassName {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Code
     }
    }

=> Output in java:-
-> Output using print() function
-> println() for next line after printing output 

    System.out.println("Hello, World!");

    Output:-
    Hello, World!   
 
 => Variables in java:-
 -> Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false
