=> Java File:-
-> file extention : .java
-> Main public Class Name and file name should match
-> to run java file main public Class should have main() method
-> Boilerplate Code:-

    class ClassName {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Code
     }
    }

=> Output in java:-
-> Output using print() function
-> println() for next line after printing output 

    System.out.println("Hello, World!");

    Output:-
    Hello, World!   
 
 => Variables in java:-
 -> Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

=> Data Types in java:-
-> java is a typed language. We need to define variables type in declaration.
-> there are two types of daya type in java : 
 1. Primitive Data Types :
    - byte (1 byte)
    - short (2 byte)
    - char (2 byte)
    - boolean (1 byte)
    - int (4 byte)
    - long (8 byte)
    - float (4 byte)
    - double (8 byte)
Note: 1 byte = 8 bit
    bit = 0 or 1

byte - Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127 (without decimals).
short - Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767 (without decimals).
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes.
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false.
int - stores integers (whole numbers) from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (without decimals)
long - stores integers (whole numbers), from  -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (without decimals), Note that you should end the value with an "L".
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99f or -19.99f , Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits, Note that you should end the value with an "f".
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 , Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits, Note that you should end the value with an "d".




 2. Non-Primitive Data Type :
    - String
    - Array
    - Class
    - Object
    - Interface

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String is a arrya of characters ,values are surrounded by double quotes.
Array - Arrays are used to store multiple values of same data type in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
        To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets [ ].
Class - A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
Objects - object is created from a class.
Interface - An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies.

=> Comments in java:-
-> Single Line Comment: // for single line comments.
    // single line comment
-> Multiline Comment : /* */ for multiline comments.
    /* multiline comment */
->Doc Type Comment : A doc comment starts with /**  and ends with */
    /**
    * A brief description of the class.
    *
    * More detailed description can go here.
    * The first sentence is used as a summary.
    * <p>Use HTML tags for formatting, like paragraphs.</p>
    *
    * @author  Author Name
    * @version 1.0
    */

=> Input in Java:-
-> The Scanner class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util package.
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    Explanation : Scanner -> class
                  sc -> object of Scanner class (in this case "sc" is used it can be anything )
                  new -> key word used to create Objects.
                  Scanner(System.in) -> Scanner class takes argument - System.in
                  System.in -> - System class
                               - "in" is a object of System class

-> nextLine() method used to take one Line input.
    String name = sc.nextLine();
       Explanation : String -> String is a class used to store string(array of characters)
                     name -> name is a object of String class (in this case "name" is used it can be anything)
                     sc -> object of Scanner class (we have created above - in this case "sc" is used it can be anything )   
                     nextLine() -> nextLine() is a method of Scanner class

-> Scanner class has different methods for different data types :
    next() ->  Reads a Single word from the user
    nextLine()	-> Reads a String value from the user
    nextByte()	-> Reads a byte value from the user
    nextShort()	-> Reads a short value from the user
    nextBoolean() -> Reads a boolean value from the user
    nextInt() -> Reads a int value from the user
    nextFloat() -> Reads a float value from the user
    nextLong() -> Reads a long value from the user
    nextDouble() -> Reads a double value from the user
