=> Java File:-
-> file extention : .java
-> Main public Class Name and file name should match
-> to run java file main public Class should have main() method
-> Boilerplate Code:-

    class ClassName {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Code
     }
    }

=> Output in java:-
-> Output using print() function
-> println() for next line after printing output 

    System.out.println("Hello, World!");

    Output:-
    Hello, World!   
 
 => Variables in java:-
 -> Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

=> Data Types in java:-
-> java is a typed language. We need to define variables type in declaration.
-> there are two types of daya type in java : 
 1. Primitive Data Types :
    - byte (1 byte)
    - short (2 byte)
    - char (2 byte)
    - boolean (1 byte)
    - int (4 byte)
    - long (8 byte)
    - float (4 byte)
    - double (8 byte)
Note: 1 byte = 8 bit
    bit = 0 or 1

byte - Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127 (without decimals).
short - Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767 (without decimals).
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes.
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false.
int - stores integers (whole numbers) from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (without decimals)
long - stores integers (whole numbers), from  -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (without decimals), Note that you should end the value with an "L".
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99f or -19.99f , Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits, Note that you should end the value with an "f".
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 , Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits, Note that you should end the value with an "d".




 2. Non-Primitive Data Type :
    - String
    - Array
    - Class
    - Object
    - Interface

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String is a arrya of characters ,values are surrounded by double quotes.
Array - Arrays are used to store multiple values of same data type in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
        To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets [ ].
Class - A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
Objects - object is created from a class.
Interface - An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies.
